### Description

Very useful when you use cazaa or Bearshare or other P2p, where you download infinity of files, but a quarter is duplicated. It compares all type of files looking for duplicates, how? you select a folder, all files in that folder will be checked and compared looking for duplicated files, it checks 3 part of the binarys and the file LEN, if a file seems to be equal to other, the programm promts for action, and shows if the file is the same.

It's like that programm of NORTON... i don't remember the name.

it uses listbox, drive list, progressbar, textbox and dir list. Uses two Binary access.

NOW UPDATED WITH PROGRESS BAR!!!!!!!!!!
 
### More Info
 
A folder

The file opened must be at least bigger than 1024 Bytes(1kb).

A list of files to delete if they are duplicated.

none, it works GREAT!, may fail with GIF files, but for that reason there is a Picture box, you decide if the file is the same.
